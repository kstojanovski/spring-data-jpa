## Introduction 
Hibernate offers several APIs to query data from the database. If you want to define your query dynamically at runtime, you can use JPAâ€™s Criteria API. In the past, Hibernate also offered its own proprietary Criteria API. It has been deprecated in Hibernate 5, and you should avoid it when implementing new use cases.
